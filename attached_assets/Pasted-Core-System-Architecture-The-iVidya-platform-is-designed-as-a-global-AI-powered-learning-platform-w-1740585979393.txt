User Input (Voice/Text) -> FastAPI Gateway -> Auth (Keycloak) ->
File Upload -> Document Parser / Video Transcription / Image Analysis ->
Milvus Vector DB -> LangChain Orchestrator ->
Mistral-7B/IndicTrans2 -> Response Generator ->
Bhashini TTS -> User Output -> Firebase/GDrive Sync
Technical Stack
Backend Framework: FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints

Authentication: Keycloak for secure identity management

MVP Development Best Practices
1. Focus on Core Problem and Features
Identify the key pain point: AI-assisted learning and tutoring

Prioritize features that directly address this problem

Implement only essential functionality for the initial release

2. User-Centered Development
Involve users throughout the development process

Collect and incorporate feedback continuously

Test with real users in scenarios that reflect actual usage

3. Agile Implementation
Break development into manageable sprints (2-week cycles recommended)

Set clear milestones with defined deliverables

Use daily standups to track progress and address blockers

Conduct sprint reviews and retrospectives

4. Quality Assurance
Implement continuous integration for early issue detection

Maintain code quality through peer reviews

Enforce testing standards for all components

Monitor performance metrics against benchmarks

5. Iterative Improvement
Launch with minimum viable features

Establish clear success metrics

Use analytics to guide feature prioritization

Plan regular update cycles based on user feedback
